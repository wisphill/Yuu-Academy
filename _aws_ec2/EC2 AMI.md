AMI is named for Amazon machine image

It's a customization of an EC2 instance.
- We can add our own configuration and monitoring, ... inside the machine.
- Faster boot time because it's pre-packaged.

AMI is built for specific region and can be copied cross region.

Type of AMI:
- Public: By AWS
- Custom AMI: By us
- Market AMI: By partner and other vendors.
