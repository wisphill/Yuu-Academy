#aws #serverless #lambda

### Lambda
- Virtual function
- Short execution, on-demand running, scaling, pay per request and support lots of language (NodeJS, Go)
- Limitations: memory, execution time, number of variables, disk, concurrency

### Lambda & VPC & RDS combination
Some use case: Lambda + VPC + RDS Proxy + RDS (multiple db connection, have to go through a proxy)
