VPC sharing is the part of Resource access manager

### Prerequisites
- If we need to facilitate to centrally managed VPC to allow multiple accounts to create application resources, VPC sharing is the best fit.
- VPC owner shares one / more subnets with other AWS accounts in the same AWS Organization
- Member accounts can created resources and access into them
- Other member accounts cannot view/ modify/ delete resources that belongs to other participants.
- Only subnets be shared.

### Resource Access Manager
- Easily and securely share AWS access to any AWS accounts or within AWS organization.
