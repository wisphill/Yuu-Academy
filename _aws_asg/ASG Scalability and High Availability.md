Scalability that means the application can handle for great loads.
Two kind of scalability:
- Vertical
- Horizontal

### Vertical Scalablity
Increase instance size like the size of EC2 instances.
It is suitable for non distributed system. 
Because it requires more hardware for scaling, so it always has limit.

### Horizontal Scalability
Increase number of instances,
It's best for microservices, distributed system, modern application.

### High availability
In AWS, it can be running application in multiple AZs. (passive)
or it can be horizontal scaling (active).
just to prevent the data loss.
